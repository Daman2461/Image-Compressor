# Image Compression App

This web application allows users to upload PNG images and compress them using a custom image compression algorithm implemented in Python.

## Features

- Upload a PNG image for compression.
- Select the number of colors (centroids) to compress the image into.
- Adjust the number of iterations for the compression algorithm.
- View the original and compressed images.
- Receive feedback on successful compression or errors.
  
## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive web application interface and hosting the project repository.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for image processing capabilities, such as opening and manipulating images.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations, especially in the image compression algorithm.
- **Python 3**: Programming language used for development.

  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Daman2461/Image-Compressor.git
